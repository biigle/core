         * is terribly slow on large tables (and these tables will be large here).
         * The same is true for cascaded deletes. If a whole image/video or volume should
         * be deleted, the feature vectors are deleted via their foreign key constraints.
         * The index is essential for this to be fast. Otherwise a query could take hours
         * or days!
