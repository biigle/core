         * Context/explanation: These tables are optimized for fast queries both by Largo
         * and (in the future) for LabelBOT. Largo needs to filter by label_id and
         * volume_id, followed by a vector sort. These tables include both IDs (although
         * they could be joined to the labels and images/videos tables) because it will
         * make the query faster. This does not benefit from a vector index because the
         * sorting always needs to consider all rows with a certain label_id and
         * volume_id. We use a compound index for the volume_id and label_id instead.
         *
         * LabelBOT will likely filter by label_tree_id and then search for most similar
         * annotations. The current plan is to dynamically create partitions for
         * these tables (one each for a label tree), so the label_tree_id is redundantly
         * included here, too. Partitioned tables combined with a vector index may be the
         * fastest way to query for "most similar" annotations that also involves
         * filtering by label_tree_id. There is some controversy, though (see below), and
         * we need to test the performance once we have real data in these tables.
         *
         * Recommends partitioning for filtered sorting:
         * https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#filtering
         *
         * Mentions impracticality of partitioning to lots (100s) of categories but also
         * mentions possible improvements to pgvector to natively support fltering:
         * https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/issues/259#issuecomment-1783872804
