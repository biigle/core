<p>
    If there already are some annotations with the selected label in the same volume, example annotation patches will be displayed at the bottom of this tab. Use these patches as a reference to decide if the label is actually the one you are looking for. You can disable the example annotations in the <a href="#settings-tab">settings tab</a>.
